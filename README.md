# VHUB User Management System

## Overview

The VHUB User Management System is a simple application designed to manage user registrations and schedules. Built using Python and MySQL, this system allows users to create accounts and automatically generates a default schedule upon registration. The schedules can be retrieved and displayed based on the user.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Create new user accounts with personal details and credentials.
- **Automatic Schedule Creation**: Upon registration, a default schedule is created for the user, which can include date, time, category, and description.
- **Display Schedule**: Retrieve and display all schedules associated with a user, organized by date and time.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL to store user data and schedules securely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- `mysql-connector-python` package

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install MySQL Connector**:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure that your MySQL server is running.
   - Modify the database connection parameters in the code if necessary (host, user, password).

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal and run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Create a New User**:
   Call the `new_user` function with the following parameters:
   ```python
   new_user(username, credentials, first_name, last_name, dob, sex, hostel, roomno, phone, emergency, email, sdate, stime, edate, etime, category, description)
   ```
   Example:
   ```python
   new_user('24BME0133', 'Arya@813', 'Swastik', 'Patnaik', '2006-08-17', 'M', 'Q', '1234', '1234567890', '7008976034', 'swasti.debesh2024@gmail.com', '2024-09-21', '10:00:00', '2024-09-21', '11:00:00', 'Meeting', 'Team meeting in the conference room')
   ```

3. **Display User Schedule**:
   To view the schedule for a specific user, use the `display_schedule` function:
   ```python
   display_schedule('24BME0133')
   ```

## Example Output

After running the above functions, you will see:
- Confirmation of user registration.
- Display of the schedule organized by date and time.

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication**: Implement login functionality to allow users to access their schedules securely.
- **Input Validation**: Enhance input validation for better data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for database operations.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a user-friendly GUI to improve user interaction.
